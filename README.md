# Matplotlib

## Overview

Provided a scenario to analyze the animal studies of anti-cancer pharmaceuticals, screening potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  Data was visualized through Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compared.

Pandas DataFrames structured allowing to build Matplotlib scattered charts and bar graphs.  Matplotlib formatting applied to include legends, line colors, data markers and error bars to clearly illustrate the data.

## Scattered Plots

A scattered plot built to show how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
